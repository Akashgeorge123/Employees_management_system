Got it 👍 Let’s re-collect everything so you have a **clear roadmap** before we start building step-by-step.

---

# 🟣 **Employee Management System (EMS) – Your Ideas + Enhancements**

## **1️⃣ Authentication & Security**

* Employee login with Employee ID + password
* Account lock after 5 failed login attempts (stored in DB)
* Admin can unlock accounts
* Role-based access: **Admin / Employee**

---

## **2️⃣ Employee Management (Admin)**

* Add new employee (auto-generate 6-digit Employee ID)
* Validate email (`@gmail.com`) and phone number (10 digits)
* Update / delete employee details
* View all employees

---

## **3️⃣ Attendance Management**

* Employees mark attendance (check-in / check-out)
* Status calculated automatically:

  * **AB** → Absent
  * **LOP** → Half-day (<9 hrs)
  * **PR** → Full day (9 hrs)
  * **PR+OT** → Overtime (>9 hrs)
  * **HD** → Holiday (not worked)
  * **PR+Double** → Worked on holiday (double salary)
* Auto-mark **AB / LOP** if attendance not given
* Override logic → if attendance is later given, it replaces AB/LOP

---

## **4️⃣ Holidays**

* Admin can mark holidays in DB
* Employees not working → **HD (paid leave)**
* Employees working → **PR+Double (double pay)**

---

## **5️⃣ Leave Management**

* Employees can request leave (reason required, casual leave limit per month)
* Admin can approve / reject
* Status: Pending → Approved / Rejected
* Leave on holiday → still paid leave

---

## **6️⃣ Notifications**

* **Admin notifications**: pending leave requests, locked accounts
* **Employee notifications**: leave approved/rejected, unread count
* Option to mark notifications as read

---

## **7️⃣ Payroll / Salary**

* **Daily wage rules**:

  * PR → 1000
  * LOP → 500
  * PR+OT → 1250
  * HD → 1000
  * PR+Double → 2000 (2250 if OT also)
* **Monthly wage**: calculated at month-end / on admin release
* Employees can view salary only after release

---

## **8️⃣ Calendar & Attendance View**

* Show attendance in terminal as a **calendar table**
* **Double-grid layout**: 2 days per row
* Show status, hours, leave, notes (double pay etc.)

---

## **9️⃣ User Experience**

* Loading spinner (2s) for leave requests
* Messages like “Submitting request…”
* Pretty table formatting (`tabulate`)
* Optional color coding (`colorama`)
* Export data to CSV

---

## **🔟 Database Tables**

* **Employees** (master table)
* **Attendance** (foreign key → Employees.emp\_id)
* **Leaves** (foreign key)
* **Notifications** (foreign key)
* **MonthlyWages** (foreign key)
* **Holidays**

👉 **Total FK references = 4 (all point to Employees.emp\_id)**

---

✅ **In short:**
Your EMS = Authentication + Employee DB + Attendance + Leave + Payroll + Notifications + Calendar View
👉 With **SQLite + Python + regex + error handling + loops + dictionaries + tabulate**

---

⚡ Now, do you want me to:

1. Start coding from **scratch step by step** (beginning with DB + employee add/view)?
   or
2. Build a **skeleton EMS project structure** first (menus + functions), then fill features one by one?
